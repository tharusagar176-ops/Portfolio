  // About Section
  about: {
    description: `I'm a passionate Computer Science & Engineering student with a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. I love solving complex problems and building innovative solutions that make a difference.

My journey in tech started when I built my first website at 15, and since then, I've been hooked on creating things with code. I'm particularly interested in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, participating in hackathons, or exploring the latest tech trends.`,
